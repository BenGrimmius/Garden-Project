# My Garden

An application for gardeners who want to create a digital model of their plants and
also view facts about them.

This application is something I have been wanting to build to help people keep track of the
plants in their garden. By adding plants, users can see how much water the individual plant needs,
along with other helpful tips to keep their plants healthy and growing.

A link to the application can be found [HERE](http://garden-project-dev.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
